## 💼 WHO I AM

I’m a full-stack developer and security-minded builder focused on **solving real-world problems with clean, scalable tech**. I don’t just write features — I find flaws, fix them, and ship systems that work under pressure.

From breaking into live class streams to architecting AI-powered helpdesks — I thrive where logic meets loopholes.

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM I SOLVED — Sheryians Coding School

> *“on September2 2025, After live class, I noticed something off — I could still access the video without being logged in.”*

I dug deeper:
- Opened DevTools → no logout triggered
- Copied the video URL → played it in incognito tab → **worked without auth**
- Recorded proof → reported responsibly → stopped immediately

✅ **Impact**: Prevented potential content leaks  
✅ **Action**: Reported privately with video evidence  
✅ **Ethics First**: Never shared exploit, never abused access

This isn’t hacking — it’s **responsible disclosure**. And it’s why teams trust me with their systems.

## 🧩 PROJECTS — Problems I Solved & How

### 1. 🔒 cyberThreat — *Red Team Toolkit for Academic Research*
**Problem**: Security tools are either too basic or illegal to use.  
**Solution**: Built an advanced, modular toolkit for authorized penetration testing — with built-in ethics guardrails.
- Obfuscated strings + stealth loaders to avoid detection
- Persistence via registry/cron + SMTP exfiltration (for lab use only)
- Auto-installer + PyInstaller build → ready for controlled environments
- ⚠️ Strict legal disclaimers + audit logs included

### 2. 🩸 BloodConnect — *Blood Donation Matching System*
**Problem**: Blood requests get lost. Donors don’t know where to go.  
**Solution**: Built a Node.js + MongoDB backend that matches donors to patients in real-time.
- JWT auth + role-based access
- Smart matching engine based on blood type, location, urgency
- Email alerts + donation tracking
- Deployed with Netlify frontend → used by 500+ people

---

### 3. 🎓 SmartCampus — *Attendance System for Colleges*
**Problem**: Manual attendance = errors, delays, fraud.  
**Solution**: Cross-platform Flutter app that lets teachers mark attendance using student photos — fast, accurate, offline-capable.
- Supabase backend + PostgreSQL
- Carousel UI for quick face-based marking
- Export reports, multi-language, calendar sync
- Deployed in 3 colleges → reduced admin time by 70%

> Teachers love it. Admins rely on it.

### 4. 🤖 PowerSupport AI — *Self-Learning Helpdesk Engine*
**Problem**: AI chatbots break when they don’t know the answer. Humans get overloaded.  
**Solution**: Designed a flow where AI routes unknown queries → suggests KB articles → admins create them → system gets smarter.
- No model retraining needed
- Mermaid flows + React hooks + AI microservices
- Trained vs Untrained path handling
- Full audit trail + auto-resolution
- **Still in Development**
